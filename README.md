age
===

Ridiculously simple python script that prints the age of a file.  It
is ridiculous because i couldn’t find any other utility that does
this without any fanfare.

Usage
==

Copy to your bin directory, make sure it’s executable, and say ‘age
FILE‘ for any file you want to know when it has been modified.
