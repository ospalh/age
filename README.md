## Scripts for this and that

This is a collection of different scripts and short programs i found
useful.  At the moment just one, but i may add other things i have
lying around at some time.

### days

Print the age of one or more files in days, using a special formatting
that i like. It repeats the file names when more than one is given, or just prints the age for one.

Use `days -h` to see more options.
